"# TD-M2-Statistique-avec-R" 
# Welcome to this Stats with R course

This is a public repository for a "statistics with R" course (Fall 2021 semester). 
The class requires no prior experience with R, and only limited knowledge of statistics. 

This repository will include: 
- the courses' slides (mostly in French) with definitions of concepts covered in class & examples of R code
- datasets we will be working with, e.g., chronolex - I will try to use mostly datasets that are related to language research so as to stay close to students' interests
- exercise' sheets to complete before the next class. Feel free to work on these in groups - since some of you are more used to R than others, it would be great to share your skills! And don't be afraid to look for help online as well, it's one of the main advantages of R that it has a large online community. copying and pasting code from stackexchange is fair game as long as you apply it to the data we are working with - no point reinventing a function/method someone already created.

# Datasets information  

### Chronolex - a dataset created by Ferran et al., 2011

Reference: Ferrand, L., Brysbaert, M., Keuleers, E., New, B., Bonin, P., Méot, A., Augustinova, M., & Pallier, C. (2011). Comparing word processing times in naming, lexical decision, and progressive demasking: Evidence from Chronolex. Frontiers in Psychology, 2:306. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00306

Description (taken from OSF): Chronolex (Ferrand, Brysbaert, Keuleers, New, Bonin, Méot, Augustinova, & Pallier, 2011) involved the collection of naming, lexical decision and progressive demasking data for 1,826 monosyllabic monomorphemic French words. Thirty-seven participants (psychology students from Blaise Pascal University) were tested in the naming task, 35 additionnal participants in the lexical decision task and 33 additionnal participants (from the same pool) were tested in the progressive demasking task.
