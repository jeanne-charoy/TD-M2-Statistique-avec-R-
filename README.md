"# TD-M2-Statistique-avec-R" 
# Welcome to this Stats with R course

This is a public repository for a "statistics with R" course (Fall 2021 semester). 
The class requires no prior experience with R, and only limited knowledge of statistics. 

This repository will include: 
- the courses' slides (mostly in French) with definitions of concepts covered in class & examples of R code
- datasets we will be working with, e.g., chronolex - I will try to use mostly datasets that are related to language research so as to stay close to students' interests
- exercise' sheets to complete before the next class. Feel free to work on these in groups - since some of you are more used to R than others, it would be great to share your skills! And don't be afraid to look for help online as well, it's one of the main advantages of R that it has a large online community. copying and pasting code from stackexchange is fair game as long as you apply it to the data we are working with - no point reinventing a function/method someone already created.
